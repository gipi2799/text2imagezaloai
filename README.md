## Overview

In the fast-paced world of digital advertising, the swift creation of captivating product banners plays a critical role. The AutoBanner Generator project addresses this challenge by inviting participants to harness the power of AI for the automatic generation of visually appealing product advertising banners. The primary goal is to develop a model that, based on provided product descriptions, can autonomously craft banners that mirror the creativity and engagement found in human-designed templates.
# Main Features
